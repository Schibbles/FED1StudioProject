            <h4>Our Instructors</h4>
            <p>
                At Kenny's School of Billiards we have some of the best pool players in the state. They have dedicated their time to learning the game and are now paying it forward by teaching others how to play a game that they and countless others have learned to love. We have classes five days a week. Our beginner courses are on Mondays and Tuesday, intermediate courses are on Wednesday and Thursday, and our advanced courses are on Fridays.

            <h4>All the newest gear!</h4>
            <p>
                Our instructors are also constantly learning and adjusting how they play. They are an important part in helping us keep up with all the newest gear coming out. From things as simple as chalk holders to which tip to put on your pool cue. We have gloves, bridges, and all sorts of cues. No matter how you shoot or how you choose to play, we have something to suit your wants and needs.
